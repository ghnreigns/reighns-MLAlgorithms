    " - *Hypothesis testing problems:* the decision is to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. Think of Linear Regression problems, they are mostly related to hypothesis testing.\n",
    " - *Classification problems:* the decision is to classify a new observation (or observations) into a category.\n",
    " - *Model selection problems:* the decision is to chose one of the candidate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, there are an infinite number of decision functions available for a problem. If we for instance are interested in estimating the height of Swedish males based on ten observations $\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{10})$, we can use any of the following decision functions $d(\\mathbf{x})$:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "How then can we determine which of these decision functions to use? One way is to use a **loss function**, which describes the loss (or cost) associated with all possible decisions. Different decision functions will tend to lead to different types of mistakes. The loss function tells us which type of mistakes we should be more concerned about. The best decision function is the function that yields the lowest **expected loss**.

    "The `confusion matrix` and the `classification report` provide a very detailed analysis of a particular set of predictions. However, the predictions themselves already threw away a lot of information that is contained in the model - to explain this statement further: We consider the example of a logistic regression classifier, used to predict whether a patient has cancer (1, positive class) or not (0, negative class). We defined Y as our response variable, outputting only 1 or 0, while X is the set of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our cancer classification model, (which we assume to be a logistic regression classifier), we remember that the positive class (class = 1) is the patient has cancer, and the negative class (class = 0) is the patient does not have cancer. And to delve a little deeper, our default classification threshold is:\n",

    "\\end{cases} \\end{equation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that whenever our logistic regression outputs a probability of the patient getting cancer is more than $0.5$, we classify the patient to be in the positive class (predict him/her to have cancer). When we use the `LogisticClassifier()` to fit and predict, we are actually predicting the probability $p(X)$, i.e.the probability of the patient having cancer given predictors X; Consequently, we need to further set a threshold, or to make a decision on whether to classify a patient as cancer or benign based on the probability we get from $$p(X) = \\dfrac{e^{\\beta_0}+\\beta_1X_1+...+\\beta_nX_n}{1+ e^{\\beta_0}+\\beta_1X_1+...+\\beta_nX_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold is defaulted to 0.5 in `predict_proba`. As we discussed earlier, most classifiers provide a `decision_function` or a `predict_proba` method to assess degrees of certainty about predictions. Making predictions can be seen as thresholding the output of `decision_function` or `predict_proba` at a certain fixed point; in binary classification we use 0 for the decision function and 0.5 for predict_proba as default.\n",

Those to the right of the classification threshold are classified as \"spam\", while those to the left are classified as \"not spam.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "I think intuitively you can say that if your model needs to perform equally well on the positive class as the negative class (for example, for classifying images between cats and dogs, you would like the model to perform well on the cats as well as on the dogs. For this you would use the ROC AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you're not really interested in how the model performs on the negative class, but just want to make sure every positive prediction is correct (precision), and that you get as many of the positives predicted as positives as possible (recall), then you should choose PR AUC. For example, for detecting cancer, you don't care how many of the negative predictions are correct, you want to make sure all the positive predictions are correct, and that you don't miss any. (In fact, in this case missing a cancer would be worse then a false positive so you'd want to put more weight towards recall.)\n",
    "\n",
    "True negatives need to be meaningful for ROC to be a good choice of measure. In his example, if we've got 1,000 pictures of cats and dogs and our model determines whether the picture is a cat (target = 0) or a dog (target = 1), we probably care just as much about getting the cats right as the dogs, and so ROC is a good choice of metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead, we've got a collection of 1,000,000 pictures and we build a model to try to identify the 1,000 dog pictures mixed in it, correctly identifying \"not-dog\" pictures is not quite as useful. Instead, it makes more sense to measure how often a picture is a dog when our model says it's a dog (i.e., precision) and how many of the dogs in the picture set we found (i.e., recall)."

In the multiclass case, these must be probability estimates which sum to 1. The binary case expects a shape (n_samples,), and the scores must be the scores of the class with the greater label. The multiclass and multilabel cases expect a shape (n_samples, n_classes). In the multiclass case, the order of the class scores must correspond to the order of labels, if provided, or else to the numerical or lexicographical order of the labels in y_true.\n",

In other words, if you have class 0 and 1, then the greater label is `np.argmax(0,1) = 1`. As a consequence, it is important that you should only pass the \"positive class\" which is the \"greater label\" here into the `y_score`. \n",

    "In multiclass, there are two cases, either you provide a `labels` argument in, say `labels = [0,2,1]` or `labels = [0,1,2]`, or if you do not provide, then the `y_score` will necessarily be in the order of the numerical/alphabetical order of the labels in `y_true`. In other words, if `y_true` has 3 unique labels: 0, 1 and 2; then the `y_score` will be a **2d-array** in the form of `y_score = [[0.2, 0.3, 0.5],[...],[...]]` where `y_score[0] = [0.2,0.3,0.5]` must correspond to class 1, 2 and 3 respectively, unless otherwise stated in `labels`.\n",

    "### First Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now ROC curve is a TPR vs FPR graph, and the AUC is the area under the curve literally. To find the ROC-AUC, we need to plot many different pairs of points on the graph, and compute the area under it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the above naive and simple example, there are a total of 6 pairs of points to plot. Those are from `fpr`, `tpr` respectively --> Allow me to further explain with this example where 1 is the positive class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y_true_1 = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1]\n",
    "    y_preds_1 = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to initialize the thresholds with a large number usually - usually `roc_curve` is written so that ROC point corresponding to the highest threshold `(fpr[0], tpr[0])` is always `(0, 0)`. If this is not the case, a new threshold is created with an arbitrary value of `max(y_score)+1`. Therefore, in this case, we get 1.8 as the first threshold. This large number will ensure the `fpr, tpr` starts at (0,0).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, when the threshold is $T=0.8$, then one can see that `y_preds_1` has 1 predictions 1, so `y_preds_1=[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]` and hence we can calculate the FPR and TPR: FPR will be 0 because no negative samples 0 are misclassified as 1 in our prediction. TPR will be 0.25 because by definition TPR=TP/TP+FN = 1/1+3=0.25 by definition. Therefore `(fpr, tpr) = (0,0.25)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $T=0.7 \\rightarrow$ `y_preds_1 = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]`, same logic, FPR will be 0 cause no negative samples 0 are classified as 1 by our classifier! But TPR will be 0.5 because TPR = TP/TP+FN = 2/2+2 = 0.5. Therefore `(fpr, tpr) = (0,0.5)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We continue this way until we exhaust all thresholds given `[array([1.8, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1])]`. And we plot on the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. How then, do we calculate the area under this curve? One can refer to the source code `auc` in `sklearn.metrics.auc` and see that they used **[Trapezoidal Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)** to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. So one have a rough idea, how the `ROC-AUC` area is computed, and one has to bear in mind that the area is calculated over all thresholds (apparently not the case as `sklearn` discretized the thresholds to reduce computing time, so you will not see the full range of thresholds here). \n",
    "\n",
    "7. As discussed earlier on [PR vs AUC](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/7207/roc-vs-precision-and-recall-curves), The key difference is that ROC curves will be the same no matter what the baseline probability is, but PR curves may be more useful in practice for needle-in-haystack type problems or problems where the \"positive\" class is more interesting than the negative class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To show this, first let's start with a very nice way to define precision, recall and specificity.  Assume you have a \"positive\" class called 1 and a \"negative\" class called 0.  $\\hat{Y}$ is your estimate of the true class label $Y$.  Then:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    &\\text{Precision} &= P(Y = 1 | \\hat{Y} = 1)  \\\\\n",
    "    &\\text{Recall} = \\text{Sensitivity} &= P(\\hat{Y} = 1 | Y = 1)  \\\\\n",
    "    &\\text{Specificity} &= P(\\hat{Y} = 0 | Y = 0)\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    The key thing to note is that sensitivity/recall and specificity, which make up the ROC curve, are probabilities *conditioned on the true class label*.  Therefore, they will be the same regardless of what $P(Y = 1)$ is.  Precision is a probability conditioned on *your estimate of the class label* and will thus vary if you try your classifier in different populations with different baseline $P(Y = 1)$.  However, it may be more useful in practice if you only care about one population with known background probability and the \"positive\" class is much more interesting than the \"negative\" class.  (IIRC precision is popular in the document retrieval field, where this is the case.)  This is because it directly answers the question, \"What is the probability that this is a real hit given my classifier says it is?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "    Interestingly, by Bayes' theorem you can work out cases where specificity can be very high and precision very low simultaneously.  All you have to do is assume $P(Y = 1)$ is very close to zero.  In practice I've developed several classifiers with this performance characteristic when searching for needles in DNA sequence haystacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    IMHO when writing a paper you should provide whichever curve answers the question you want answered (or whichever one is more favorable to your method, if you're cynical).  If your question is: \"How meaningful is a positive result from my classifier *given the baseline probabilities of my problem*?\", use a PR curve.  If your question is, \"How well can this classifier be expected to perform *in general, at a variety of different baseline probabilities*?\", go with a ROC curve.\n",

As we can see, we must pass in the `y_true` and `classes` in which if our classes are `[0,1,2,3,4,5]` then we need to specify in the `labels` argument of `roc_auc_curve`. If we do not specify, the `_encode` will help us as well, so it is up to one's preference if your labels order matter.\n",

    "First off, we define the formula exactly as mentioned. Quoting from the evaluation page: **Submissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.** \n",

    "**The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that $O_{i,j}$ corresponds to the number of `isup_grade`'s i (actual) that received a predicted value j. An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:**\n",

    "An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted rating scores. The formula is as follows:  $$w_{i,j} = \\dfrac{(i-j)^2}{(N-1)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Under Step-2, each element is weighted. Predictions that are further away from actuals are marked harshly than predictions that are closer to actuals. However, I suddenly realized that these animals above have no obvious hierarchy in them. Therefore, it is not correct to say that predicting a cat as a bird is any better/worse off than predicting a cat as hen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consequently, this is a realization. Because now I start to understand why certain competitions use metrics like quadratic weighted kappa!** Consider the same example as animals just now, but instead of animals, we change to **isup_grade**). So there is an inherent order within the **isup_grade** 0 - 5 such that 0 and 1 is closer than 0 and 2, 1 and 2 is closer to 1 and 3 etc. $$0 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's use a simplified example:\n",

    "    y_true = [2,2,2,1,2,3,4,5,0,1]\n",
    "    y_pred = [1,2,4,1,2,3,4,5,0,1]\n",
    "    \n",
    "As a result, our purpose of the weighted matrix is to allocate a higher penalty score if our prediction is further away from the actual value. That is, if our **isup_grade** is 2 but we predicted it as 1 (see the example), then based on our formula above, we have i = 2 and j = 1 (entry $C_{2,1}$), the penalty is $$\\dfrac{(2-1)^2}{(5-1)^2}  = 0.0625$$ but if our **isup_grade** is 2 and we predicted it as 4 (see the example), then the penalty involved is higher $$\\dfrac{(2-4)^2}{(5-1)^2} = 0.25$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the weight matrix helped us assign a heavier penalty to predicting 2 as 4 than 2 as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Lastly, we also observe that the formula will give us 0 for the diagonals of the weighted matrix. This means penalty is 0 whenever we correctly predict something.***"

    "This part is the most difficult to understand, especially for someone who has little statistic backgrounds (mind you when I was majoring in applied math back then, I only took **one** statistic module in my whole tenure.) Googling the idea of expected matrix is not apparently clear to me, but luckily someone pointed to me to read expected frequency of Chi-Square test and then and, there I start to slowly understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of better understanding, we call our actual values to be rater A and our prediction model to be rater B. We want to quantify the agreement between rater A and rater B. Here are some terminologies to get hold of first.\n",

    "- There are a total number of $k = 5$ classes in this example;\n",

    "- $r_i$ be the i-th entry of the column vector for actual value counts shown above, $c_i$ be the i-th entry of the column vector for prediction value counts shown above.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the probability of rater A choosing class 2 and rater B choosing class 2 for example, is given by $$P(Y = 2 \\text{ and } \\widehat{Y} = 2)  = P(Y = 2) \\cdot P(\\widehat{Y} = 2) = 30\\% \\times 40\\%  = 12\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is under the assumption that both raters are **independent of each other**. Note that $P(Y = 2) = 30\\%$ because as we see from the actual value counts of rater $A$, there are a total of 3 class 2's and therefore the probability of Y being 2 is just the proportion. Similarly, we calculate $\\widehat{Y}$ the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the formula of rater A choosing class i and rater B choosing (predicting) class j is given as follows: $$P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j) =  P(Y = i) \\times P (\\widehat{Y} = j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the real question comes: On average, if you have $n$ number of points to predict, how many times (what is the frequency) would you **expect** to see rater A choose class i and rater B choose class j.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, recall that the probability of the actual class being 1 **and (super important word here, it means a joint distribution)** and the predicted class to be 1 as well is $P(Y = 1 \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = 1)$, similarly, the probability of the actual class being 1 and the predicted class to be 2 is $P(Y = 1 \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = 2)$. Generalizing, the probability of the actual class being $i$ and the predicted class being $j$ is the joint probability $$P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the intuition lies here: based on the joint probability above, what is the expected number of times (frequency) that $Y = i$ and $\\widehat{Y} = j$ happened (this means Y is i but rater B predict $\\widehat{Y}$ as j) out of 10 times? Easy, just use $n \\times P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j)$. So for rater B, our prediction model, **by just using theoretical probability**, should have $n \\times P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j)$ for each $i,j$. But in reality, this may not be the case. Reconcile this idea with the classic coin toss example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example on coin toss:** Expected frequency is defined as the number of times that we predict an event will occur based on a calculation using theoretical probabilities. You know how a coin has two sides, heads or tails? That means that the probability of the coin landing on any one side is 50% (or 1/2, because it can land on one side out of two possible sides). If you flip a coin 1,000 times, how many times would you expect to get heads? About half the time, or 500 out of the 1,000 flips. To calculate the expected frequency, all we need to do is multiply the total number of tosses (1,000) by the probability of getting a heads (1/2), and we get 1,000 * 1/2 = 500 heads. if event A has prob of p happening, and sample size of n, then the average or expected number of times that A happens is $np$. The expected frequency of heads is 500 out of 1,000 total tosses. The expected frequency is based on our knowledge of probability - we haven't actually done any coin tossing. However, if we had enough time on our hands, we could actually flip a coin 1,000 times to experimentally test our prediction. If we did this, we would be calculating the experimental frequency. The experimental frequency is defined as the number of times that we observe an event to occur when we actually perform an experiment, test, or trial in real life. If you flipped a coin 1,000 times and it landed on heads 479 times, then the experimental frequency of heads is 479.\n",
    "\n",
    "    But wait - didn't we predict the coin would land on heads 500 times? Why did it actually land on heads only 479 times? Well, the expected frequency was just that - what we expected to happen, based on our knowledge of probability. There are no guarantees when it comes to probability, what we expect to happen might differ from what actually happens. \n",

However, from our observations in our matrix C (confusion/histogram matrix), rater A choosing 2 and rater B choosing 2 have a frequency of 3!
