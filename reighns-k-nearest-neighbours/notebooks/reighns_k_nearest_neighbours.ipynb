    "We need to normalize our data before performing KNN. The reasons are as follows, and for visualization see notebook's Normalization Section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you had a dataset (m \"examples\" by n \"features\") and all but one feature dimension had values strictly between 0 and 1, while a single feature dimension had values that range from -1000000 to 1000000. When taking the euclidean distance between pairs of \"examples\", the values of the feature dimensions that range between 0 and 1 may become uninformative and the algorithm would essentially rely on the single dimension whose values are substantially larger. Just work out some example euclidean distance calculations and you can understand how the scale affects the nearest neighbor computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Introduction to Statistical Learning, it is also mentioned that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because the KNN classifier predicts the class of a given test observation by identifying the observations that are nearest to it, the scale of the variables matters. Variables that are on a large scale will have a much larger effect on the distance between the observations, and hence on the KNN classifier, than variables that are on a small scale. For instance, imagine a data set that contains two variables, salary and age (measured in dollars and years, respectively). As far as KNN is concerned, a difference of 1,000 in salary is enormous compared to a difference of 50 years in age. Consequently, salary will drive the KNN classification results, and age will have almost no effect. This is contrary to our intuition that a salary difference of 1,000 is quite small compared to an age difference of 50 years. Furthermore, the importance of scale to the KNN classifier leads to another issue: if we measured salary in Japanese yen, or if we measured age in minutes, then weâ€™d get quite different classification results from what we get if these two variables are measured in dollars and years.\n"
